# RNA-seq trimming

This directory contains the results of RNA-seq read trimming.

## Tool

- Trimmomatic

## Input

- Raw Illumina RNA-seq reads

## Output

- Trimmed paired-end reads
- Unpaired reads (if generated)

## Purpose

Trimming removes low-quality bases and adapter sequences to improve mapping
accuracy in downstream analyses.
