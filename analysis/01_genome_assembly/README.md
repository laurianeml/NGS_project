# Genome assembly

This directory contains files and scripts related to the de novo genome
assembly of *Enterococcus faecium* using long-read sequencing data.

## Data and methods

- Sequencing technology: PacBio (long reads)
- Assembly tool: Canu

Due to computational resource limitations, the genome assembly was provided
by the instructor and used directly for downstream analyses.

## Output

- Assembled genome contigs in FASTA format

## Purpose

The assembled genome serves as the reference for genome annotation and
RNA-seq mapping.
